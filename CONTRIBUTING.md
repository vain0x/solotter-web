### Dev: Notes on TypeScript and Build Process

We use **TypeScript** for both server/client apps.
Config files for server/client apps are *same*.
Sharing config files (tsconfig and tslint) for them seems to simplify build process.

Build tools for server/client apps are *different*.

- To build the client app, **Webpack** bundles scripts into single file `/dist/public/scripts/bundle.js`.
- To build the server app, **tsc** (TypeScript Compiler) converts multiple typescript files to multiple javascript files.
